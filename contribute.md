# How you can contribute to OpenRocket ðŸš€

OpenRocket is an Open Source project, meaning that the source code is freely available and anybody can help make the software better. You don't even need coding skills, as there are other things to do as well.

Below are a few suggestions of areas that would need help. If you'd like to participate, you can send us a message [on Slack](contact.html#slack), file an issue for your suggestion [on GitHub](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/issues) or [join the development mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/openrocket-devel) and introduce your ideas there.

 - Java development
 - Aerodynamic computation methods
 - Documentation
 - Other

**To help you guide through the different roles of an OpenRocket contributer you can read [our contribution guidelines](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/blob/unstable/CONTRIBUTING.md).**

## Java development

Below are a few ideas about what kind of input developers can provide or features that could be implemented. For more information see the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/issues) and feature roadmap in the distribution [TODO-file.](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/blob/master/core/TODO)

 - 3D visualization of the rocket during design and flight (Help needed!)
 - Printing of designs, simulation results, fin planforms etc
 - Memory profiling and leakage reduction
 - Writing RockSim design files
 - UI enhancements, for example zooming plots etc.
 - Application and WebService integrations
 - WebService and CloudStorage


## Aerodynamic computation methods

There is still work to be done in the aerodynamic computation methods of OpenRocket. At least the following items need help. I will gladly provide help in creating and even implementing the computational methods.

 - Simulating rockets at supersonic velocities (drag coefficient and CG position).
 - Support for external pods and tube fins
 - CFD methods for simulation


## Documentation tasks

Contributions to the [OpenRocket User's guide](https://wiki.openrocket.info/User%27s_Guide) are dearly needed. Below are examples of topics.

 - Getting started guide
 - How to make staged and clustered designs
 - Using mass/CG overrides for simulation accuracy
 - Using simulations
 - Effect of the simulation parameters
 - Simulation method limitations
 - Using simulation listeners (including examples)

## Testing

Testers are both a developer's best friend and worst nightmare. They test new features and push OpenRocket to the limits to discover new bugs, or propose useful additions to the program. If you noticed anomalies in OpenRocket's behavior or have a cool idea, don't be afraid to create [an issue on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket/issues/new/choose).

## Other

 - [Translating OpenRocket](http://openrocket.trans.free.fr/) to your language
 - Creating good and interesting example designs that demonstrate some OpenRocket features.
 - Hosting a place to share rocket designs with other enthusiasts.
 - Giving input and suggestions on how to make OpenRocket better.
