Before beginning, you will need to have the FUSE filesystem installed; most distributions have it installed by default. Download the AppImage file from the link below and run it by double-clicking, or from the command line.

The Linux package is an AppImage.  Download it, make it executable: `chmod +x OpenRocket-15.03.AppImage`  
and run it: `./OpenRocket-15.03.AppImage`
