The Windows package is a Windows installer.  Download
it and double click on the icon to start the installation process.
The application uses a standard installer, but it doesn't (at present)
provide a shortcut on the desktop or the start menu. After installing, the actual
executable file for the application is installed into your user/AppData/Local/OpenRocket
folder. So you can go in there, right click the "OpenRocket.exe" file, and create a shortcut,
pin it to the taskbar and/or pin it in the start menu.
